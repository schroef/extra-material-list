# Extra Material List

>Original Addon & documentation can be found at: <b>[MeshLogic / Extra Material List](https://meshlogic.github.io/posts/blender/addons/extra-material-list/)</b>

Have you ever struggled with the tiny pop-up list in the material Node Editor? So have I!

Therefore, I made an addon that enables to pop-up an extra material list with specified number of rows and columns. Optionally, you can display all materials in a plain list.

Moreover, there is a button to remove material and node group duplicates (ending with .001, .002, etc), which might occur after appending assets from external files.
